## Traditional Lime Plastering for Heritage Properties in Gloucestershire

Lime plastering isn't just another building trade – it's a craft that has protected buildings for thousands of years. Unlike modern cement-based products, lime allows your walls to breathe, preventing the moisture build-up that causes so many problems in old buildings.

### Why Lime Matters

Before the 20th century, virtually every building was constructed using lime. The walls, the renders, the mortars – all lime-based. These materials worked in harmony with traditional construction methods, allowing moisture to pass through the building fabric rather than trapping it inside.

When modern materials like cement render and gypsum plaster are applied to old buildings, they create a barrier that prevents this natural process. The result? Trapped moisture, crumbling stonework, mould growth, and eventually structural damage.

### Our Lime Plastering Services

**Lime Render**
External lime renders protect your walls while allowing them to breathe. We mix renders to match your existing finishes, using appropriate aggregates to achieve the right colour and texture.

**Internal Lime Plaster**
Internal lime plastering creates beautiful, breathable wall finishes. We work with both traditional multi-coat systems and modern lime plaster formulations, depending on what's most appropriate for your building.

**Lime Pointing & Repointing**
Pointing is often the first thing to fail on old buildings. We carefully rake out failed mortar and repoint using lime mortars that match the original – never cement, which can damage your stonework.

**Lime Wash & Lime Paint**
Traditional lime-based finishes for both internal and external use. Breathable, naturally antibacterial, and with a distinctive soft appearance that ages beautifully.

### Listed Buildings & Conservation Work

We understand the requirements of working on listed buildings and within conservation areas. Our methods and materials are appropriate for even the most sensitive heritage projects, and we're happy to work with conservation officers to ensure our proposals meet approval.

### The Right Materials

We only use quality lime products from reputable suppliers. Depending on the project, this might include:

- Natural hydraulic limes (NHL 2, NHL 3.5, NHL 5)
- Non-hydraulic/fat lime putty
- Pozzolanic additives where appropriate
- Locally-sourced aggregates for authentic appearance

### Our Commitment

We're confident in our materials and methods, and we stand behind every project we complete. Quality craftsmanship using traditional techniques ensures lasting results for your property.
