## Professional Lime Rendering for Period Properties

Lime rendering is one of the most important services we provide for heritage buildings across the Cotswolds. Unlike modern cement renders that trap moisture and cause stone decay, traditional lime render works with your building's natural structure, allowing solid walls to breathe while providing lasting weather protection.

### Why Lime Rendering Matters for Cotswold Stone

Cotswold stone properties were never designed for cement-based products. These beautiful buildings, from Grade II Listed Georgian townhouses to humble stone barn conversions, rely on breathable materials to manage moisture. When cement render is applied to Cotswold stone, it creates a waterproof barrier that traps moisture inside the wall, leading to:

- **Stone decay and spalling** as trapped water freezes and expands
- **Rising damp symptoms** as moisture cannot escape through the walls
- **Salt crystallisation** damaging internal plaster and decorations
- **Structural problems** as the stone deteriorates over time

Traditional lime render, by contrast, allows moisture to pass through the wall naturally – the building can "breathe" as it was designed to do.

### Our Lime Rendering Services

**External Lime Render**
We apply traditional lime render to external walls using hydraulic lime (NHL) suited to the exposure conditions of your property. Our renders are mixed with locally-sourced aggregates to complement the warm honey tones of Cotswold stone.

**Lime Render Repairs**
Many properties have patches of failed cement render alongside original lime work. We carefully remove inappropriate materials and blend new lime render seamlessly with existing surfaces.

**Render Removal**
Where cement render has been applied to historic buildings, we can carefully remove it and restore the wall to its proper breathable state – either with new lime render or exposed stone pointing.

**Breathable Mineral Paints**
For rendered surfaces, we recommend breathable mineral paints that maintain the vapour permeability of the lime render beneath. We can advise on appropriate finishes for your property.

### Materials We Use

**Hydraulic Lime (NHL)**
For most external rendering work, we use natural hydraulic lime (NHL 3.5 or NHL 5) depending on exposure. These limes set through a chemical reaction with water, providing durability and weather resistance while remaining breathable.

**Fat Lime (Non-Hydraulic)**
For sheltered situations and internal work, traditional fat lime (lime putty) offers even greater breathability. Fat lime sets through carbonation – absorbing CO2 from the air – making it the most traditional option.

**Aggregates**
We source sands and aggregates locally where possible, matching the colour and texture of original renders. This attention to detail ensures repairs blend naturally with existing work.

### The Lime Rendering Process

**1. Survey and Specification**
Every lime rendering project starts with a thorough assessment. We examine the existing wall construction, identify any damp issues, and specify appropriate materials for the conditions.

**2. Preparation**
Proper preparation is essential. We remove loose material, rake out joints where necessary, and ensure the substrate is suitable for the new render.

**3. Application**
Lime render is typically applied in two or three coats, allowing each to cure properly before the next. This takes longer than cement work but produces far superior results.

**4. Finishing**
The final coat can be finished in various ways – from a smooth, floated surface to a more rustic texture. We match the finish to your property's character and any conservation requirements.

### Solving Damp in Solid Walls

One of the most common reasons clients contact us for lime rendering is damp problems in period properties. Often, these issues stem from previous inappropriate repairs – cement pointing, modern renders, or non-breathable paints preventing stone decay.

By restoring breathability to your walls with lime render, you address the root cause of many damp issues. Combined with proper maintenance of gutters, drains, and ground levels, this approach solves damp problems permanently rather than masking symptoms.
