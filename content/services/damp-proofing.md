## Comprehensive Damp Solutions

Damp isn't just unsightly – it damages your property and can affect your health. But before reaching for a "solution," it's crucial to understand what's actually causing the problem. That's where we start.

### Understanding Damp

Not all damp is the same, and the wrong treatment can be worse than no treatment at all. We see countless properties where previous "damp proofing" has actually made things worse by trapping moisture inside the walls.

**Rising Damp**
Moisture drawn up through the walls from the ground. Genuine rising damp is less common than the damp-proofing industry would have you believe, but when it does occur, it needs proper treatment.

**Penetrating Damp**
Water entering through the building fabric – failed pointing, cracked render, defective gutters. Often the simplest damp problems to solve, once correctly diagnosed.

**Condensation**
Warm, moist air meeting cold surfaces. Increasingly common in modern, well-sealed homes but also affects older properties with inadequate ventilation.

### Our Approach

**1. Proper Diagnosis**
We start with a thorough survey to understand what's causing your damp problem. No guesswork, no rushing to sell you treatments you might not need.

**2. Address the Cause**
The best damp treatment often means fixing the actual cause – repointing, improving drainage, sorting ventilation. We'll always recommend the most appropriate solution, not the most expensive one.

**3. Appropriate Treatment**
When active treatment is needed, we use BBA-certified products and proven methods. All work is completed to the highest standards.

**4. Making Good**
Damp treatment often means removing affected plaster. We use breathable lime plasters for re-plastering – never gypsum or cement-based products that will trap moisture.

### Our Damp Proofing Services

**Damp Surveys**
Comprehensive assessment of your damp problems, including moisture readings, salt analysis where appropriate, and clear recommendations.

**Rising Damp Treatment**
When genuine rising damp is diagnosed, we provide effective treatment using injected damp-proof courses and appropriate re-plastering.

Identifying and rectifying the source of water ingress, from pointing repairs to render restoration.

Advice and solutions for ventilation improvements, insulation strategies, and environmental control.
