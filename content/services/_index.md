## Traditional Craft, Modern Expertise

Period properties across the Cotswolds and Gloucestershire share a common need: breathable, lime-based materials that work with their original construction rather than against it. Whether your building suffers from failing cement render, damp walls, or deteriorating plaster, the answer almost always lies in returning to the traditional materials it was designed to use.

With over 35 years of hands-on experience restoring heritage buildings — from Grade II Listed Regency terraces to humble stone cottages — we provide the specialist skills these properties demand. We use proper lime: hydraulic lime (NHL) for external work, fat lime putty for internal plastering, and carefully matched aggregates for an authentic finish every time.

**[Lime Rendering](/services/lime-rendering/)** — External lime renders using hydraulic lime (NHL) to protect and restore your building's facade. The breathable alternative to damaging cement render.

**[Lime Plastering](/services/lime-plastering/)** — Internal lime plaster finishes, lime pointing, and traditional haired lime plaster systems that let your walls breathe and stay dry.

**[Damp Proofing](/services/damp-proofing/)** — Diagnosis and treatment of rising damp, penetrating damp, and condensation. We fix the cause, not just the symptoms.
