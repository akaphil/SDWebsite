## Lime Rendering & Plastering Specialists Serving Cirencester

Cirencester, the historic capital of the Cotswolds, sits at the heart of one of England's most architecturally significant areas. From Roman foundations to elegant Georgian townhouses, from honey-coloured Cotswold stone cottages to substantial stone barn conversions – the buildings here span two millennia of heritage and deserve specialist care.

### The Cotswolds' Exceptional Building Heritage

The Cirencester area lies within the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), where building regulations and conservation requirements reflect the importance of preserving this unique landscape. Properties here share common characteristics that demand knowledgeable treatment:

**Cotswold Stone Cottages** are the quintessential image of the area. Built from locally quarried limestone, these properties glow with that distinctive honey colour that has made the Cotswolds famous worldwide. The stone was traditionally bedded in lime mortar and rendered with lime – materials that work in harmony with the porous limestone, allowing buildings to breathe and preventing stone decay.

**Listed Georgian Townhouses** line Cirencester's historic streets, many dating from the town's prosperity as a market centre. These substantial properties often feature fine architectural details – mullioned windows, decorative string courses, and carefully proportioned facades. Any lime rendering or plastering work on these Grade II Listed buildings must respect their historic significance and comply with AONB regulations.

**Stone Barn Conversions** have transformed the agricultural landscape around Cirencester over recent decades. These conversions present particular challenges – substantial stone walls built for livestock rather than human comfort often suffer from damp when inappropriate modern materials are used. We've helped countless barn conversion owners solve damp in solid walls by restoring breathability with proper lime render and lime plaster.

### Why Traditional Lime is Essential Here

The Cotswold limestone from which most local buildings are constructed is inherently porous. It absorbs moisture from driving rain and releases it gradually as conditions dry. This is entirely normal and how the buildings were designed to function.

Problems arise when modern materials are applied:

- **Cement render** creates a waterproof shell that traps moisture inside the wall
- **Gypsum plaster** prevents internal moisture escape, leading to damp and mould
- **Masonry paint** seals the stone surface, preventing natural breathing
- **Cement pointing** is too hard and causes adjacent stonework to crack and spall

The result? Trapped moisture, stone decay, salt crystallisation, and chronic damp problems that no amount of "damp proofing" can solve.

Traditional lime rendering and lime plastering restore the breathability these buildings need. Using hydraulic lime (NHL) appropriate to exposure conditions, we create renders that protect against driving rain while still allowing moisture vapour to pass through the wall. The building can breathe as its builders intended.

### Our Work in Cirencester and the Surrounding Villages

**Sapperton** is home to some truly exceptional properties, including buildings associated with the Arts and Crafts movement. The village's cottages and manor houses require careful, sympathetic treatment – rushed work simply won't do here. We've completed numerous lime rendering and lime plastering projects in Sapperton, always taking time to match mortars and finishes to the existing fabric.

**Fairford**, famous for its magnificent medieval church with complete set of medieval stained glass, has a wonderful mix of building ages and styles. From humble cottages to substantial townhouses, we adapt our approach to each project while maintaining consistent quality.

**Bibury** – often called England's prettiest village – presents particular responsibilities. The iconic Arlington Row cottages and the buildings surrounding them are among the most photographed in the country. Any work here must be exemplary, and our attention to detail has earned us repeat commissions in this demanding location.

**The Ampneys, Barnsley, and surrounding villages** contain countless period properties that benefit from our expertise. Whether it's a small pointing repair or complete external re-rendering, we bring the same professionalism and traditional methods.

### Meeting AONB and Conservation Requirements

Working within the Cotswolds AONB means understanding the particular requirements that apply to building work. Conservation officers rightly expect:

- **Appropriate materials** – genuine lime mortars, not cement-based products
- **Sympathetic finishes** – renders and plasters that complement the local vernacular
- **Reversible repairs** – work that future generations can maintain using traditional methods
- **Minimal intervention** – doing what's necessary, not wholesale replacement

Our experience working with conservation officers across Gloucestershire means we can advise on what's likely to be acceptable and prepare applications where necessary. We're happy to liaise directly with planning authorities on your behalf.

### Materials for Cotswold Buildings

For Cirencester area properties, we typically specify:

**Hydraulic Lime (NHL 3.5)** for most external renders – providing durability and weather resistance while maintaining breathability

**Fat Lime Putty** for internal plastering and sheltered external situations – the most traditional option with maximum breathability

**Locally-Matched Aggregates** – sands sourced to complement the warm Cotswold stone tones

**Breathable Mineral Paints** where colour finish is required – maintaining vapour permeability
