## Lime Plastering & Damp Proofing Specialists Serving Cirencester

Cirencester, the historic capital of the Cotswolds, is surrounded by some of England's most beautiful villages. From Roman foundations to Georgian elegance, this area's buildings span two millennia of architectural heritage – and they deserve specialist care.

### The Cirencester Area's Unique Building Heritage

As one of Britain's oldest towns, Cirencester and its surrounding villages contain an exceptional concentration of listed buildings and heritage properties. The local Cotswold limestone, quarried from sites around the area, gives these buildings their distinctive honey-coloured appearance.

Many properties still retain their original lime mortars and renders, while others have suffered from inappropriate repairs using modern materials. We're here to help restore and maintain these buildings using the techniques they were designed for.

### Our Work in Sapperton, Fairford & Baunton

**Sapperton** is home to some truly exceptional period properties, including buildings associated with the Arts and Crafts movement. The village's cottages and manor houses require careful, sympathetic treatment – rushed work simply won't do here.

In **Fairford**, famous for its magnificent medieval church, we've worked on properties ranging from humble cottages to substantial townhouses. The market town's mix of building ages and styles means we need to adapt our approach to each project.

**Baunton's** quiet lanes hide some lovely old buildings, many with original features that need protecting. We've helped homeowners here address damp issues while preserving the character that makes their properties special.

### Why Choose Us for Your Cirencester Property

The Cirencester area has no shortage of builders offering "quick fix" solutions. But if you value your property's heritage – and its long-term health – you need specialists who understand:

- **Lime's properties**: Why breathability matters for old buildings
- **Local stone**: How different Cotswold limestones behave
- **Listed building requirements**: Working within conservation guidelines
- **Long-term thinking**: Solutions that last, not patches that fail

We've built our reputation on doing the job properly, using the right materials, and standing behind our work with a comprehensive guarantee.
