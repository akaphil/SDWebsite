## Heritage Restoration Specialists for the Cotswolds

The Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) contains some of England's most treasured historic buildings. From honey-coloured limestone cottages to grand Georgian manor houses, these properties represent centuries of craftsmanship – and they deserve specialist care that respects their heritage.

### The Unique Challenge of Cotswold Stone

Cotswold limestone – the beautiful oolitic limestone that gives the region its distinctive character – presents unique challenges for building maintenance. This honey-coloured stone is inherently porous, designed by nature (and by centuries of builders) to absorb and release moisture naturally.

<div class="content-block content-block--gold">
<h4>Why Traditional Materials Matter</h4>
<p>Cotswold stone buildings were constructed using lime mortars, lime renders, and lime plasters. These materials work in harmony with the porous stone, allowing buildings to breathe. When modern cement-based products are applied, they trap moisture inside the walls, leading to stone decay, damp problems, and structural damage.</p>
</div>

### Understanding AONB Regulations

Properties within the Cotswolds AONB are subject to particular planning requirements designed to protect the area's special character. Conservation officers expect:

- **Traditional materials** – lime mortars, lime renders, and breathable finishes
- **Sympathetic repairs** – work that matches the existing character
- **Appropriate colours** – finishes that complement the local stone
- **Reversible methods** – repairs future generations can maintain

We have extensive experience working within these requirements and can advise on specifications likely to receive approval.

### Property Types We Work With

<div class="feature-grid">
<div class="feature-box">
<h4>Grade II Listed Buildings</h4>
<p>From Georgian townhouses to medieval cottages, we understand the requirements of working on listed properties and liaising with conservation officers.</p>
</div>
<div class="feature-box feature-box--gold">
<h4>Cotswold Stone Cottages</h4>
<p>The quintessential Cotswold property – built from local limestone and requiring breathable lime finishes to stay healthy.</p>

<div class="feature-box feature-box--slate">
<h4>Stone Barn Conversions</h4>
<p>Agricultural buildings converted to homes often suffer from damp when modern materials are used. We restore breathability.</p>

<div class="feature-box">
<h4>Period Property Restoration</h4>
<p>Victorian, Georgian, and earlier properties all benefit from traditional lime rendering and plastering techniques.</p>

### Common Problems We Solve

**Damp in Solid Walls**
Many Cotswold properties suffer from damp caused by previous inappropriate repairs. Cement pointing, modern renders, and non-breathable paints all prevent the natural moisture movement these buildings need.

**Stone Decay and Spalling**
When moisture is trapped inside Cotswold stone, freeze-thaw cycles cause the surface to flake and crumble. Restoring breathability with [lime render](/services/lime-rendering/) prevents further damage.

**Failed Cement Repairs**
Cement-based repairs are too hard for soft limestone and cause adjacent stone to crack. We remove inappropriate materials and replace them with compatible lime mortars.
