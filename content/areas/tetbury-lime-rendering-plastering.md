## Lime Rendering & Plastering Experts for Tetbury & the Southern Cotswolds

Tetbury's picture-perfect market town centre and the grand estates of the surrounding countryside represent some of the finest traditional architecture in the Cotswolds. From the iconic Market House dominating the town centre to the honey-coloured Cotswold stone cottages lining the steep streets, these buildings demand craftsmen who truly understand their unique requirements.

### Tetbury's Rich Architectural Heritage

Tetbury's buildings tell the story of centuries of prosperity and careful stewardship. The town grew wealthy through the wool trade, and that prosperity is reflected in the quality of construction you see today – substantial stone buildings, generous proportions, and fine architectural details that have survived because they were built to last.

**The Historic Town Centre** features buildings ranging from medieval foundations to Georgian elegance. Long Street's impressive wool merchants' houses, the 17th-century Market House, and the numerous listed cottages and townhouses create an architectural ensemble of national significance. Any lime rendering or lime plastering work here must respect this heritage and comply with strict conservation requirements.

**Estate Villages and Cottages** surrounding Tetbury have their own distinctive character. Villages like Westonbirt, Shipton Moyne, and Beverston grew up around historic manor houses and farmsteads. Many cottages were built as estate housing, sharing common building traditions and materials that we understand intimately from years of working in these communities.

**Agricultural Buildings and Barn Conversions** are common throughout the area. The rolling countryside contains numerous stone barns, many now converted to residential use. These stone barn conversions present particular challenges – substantial walls designed for agricultural use often struggle with damp when treated with inappropriate modern materials. Proper lime render and lime plaster restores breathability and creates comfortable living spaces.

### The Challenge of Exposed Locations

Tetbury sits on the high wold, exposed to weather sweeping across from the Severn Valley. This exposed position means buildings here face particular challenges:

- **Driving rain** penetrating porous stonework
- **Freeze-thaw cycles** causing damage to trapped moisture
- **Wind exposure** accelerating weathering of external finishes

Traditional lime render, properly specified for these conditions, provides the answer. We typically use NHL 3.5 or NHL 5 hydraulic lime for exposed elevations – strong enough to resist weathering while remaining breathable enough to allow the wall to dry between storms.

### Working on Grade II Listed Properties

Many Tetbury area properties are Grade II Listed, reflecting their architectural and historic significance. Working on listed buildings requires:

**Understanding** of what makes the building significant and how proposed work affects that significance

**Appropriate materials** – lime mortars, lime renders, and lime plasters that match original specifications

**Skilled application** – traditional techniques that produce authentic results

**Documentation** – where required, listed building consent applications properly prepared and supported

We've completed numerous lime rendering and lime plastering projects on listed buildings throughout the Tetbury area. Our work is regularly approved by conservation officers, and we're happy to liaise with planning authorities on your behalf.

### Solving Damp in Tetbury Properties

The combination of solid stone walls and exposed locations means damp problems are common in Tetbury area properties. We see the same issues repeatedly:

**Previous inappropriate repairs** – cement pointing, modern renders, non-breathable paints – all preventing the building from breathing naturally

**Failed modern treatments** – chemical damp proof courses that haven't addressed the root cause

**Condensation issues** – solid walls without insulation meeting warm, moist internal air

Our approach focuses on the building as a whole system. We identify why damp is occurring – whether that's external water ingress, rising damp, or condensation – and address the cause rather than masking symptoms. Often this means:

- Removing cement render and replacing with breathable lime render
- Repointing with NHL lime mortar to restore proper moisture movement
- Replastering internally with lime plaster instead of gypsum
- Improving ventilation and addressing condensation at source

The result is a drier, healthier building that functions as its builders intended.

### Our Work Around Westonbirt and Beyond

**Westonbirt** has a special place in our work. The famous arboretum and the magnificent Westonbirt School (formerly Westonbirt House) anchor an area filled with estate cottages and substantial period properties. The quality expected here is exceptional, and we've been proud to work on many buildings in this demanding location.

**Shipton Moyne and Beverston** are quintessential Cotswold villages – quiet lanes, stone cottages, and a timeless atmosphere. Many properties have suffered from well-meaning but inappropriate repairs over the years. We help owners restore breathability and address the damp problems that cement repairs have caused.

**Leighterton, Cherington, and the surrounding villages** contain wonderful examples of vernacular Cotswold building. From modest cottages to substantial farmhouses, we adapt our approach while maintaining consistent quality and attention to detail.

### What Makes Us Different

**Experience**: Over 35 years working on period properties in the Cotswolds gives us deep understanding of local building traditions and materials.

**Proper Materials**: We use genuine lime – hydraulic lime (NHL) and fat lime – never cement-based products marketed as "lime."

**Traditional Techniques**: Our craftsmen are trained in traditional lime plastering methods, not just modern approximations.

**Honest Advice**: We tell you what your building needs, not what generates the biggest invoice. Sometimes that means recommending maintenance over major work.
