## Your Local Lime Plastering & Damp Proofing Experts in Stroud

Based right here in Stroud, we've spent decades working on the beautiful period properties that make this area so special. From the grand wool merchant houses of Painswick to the traditional weavers' cottages dotted around the valleys, we understand what makes these buildings tick.

### Why Stroud Properties Need Specialist Care

The Stroud valleys are home to some of Gloucestershire's finest heritage buildings. Many were built using local Cotswold stone and traditional lime mortars – materials that have allowed these structures to stand for centuries. The key to their longevity? They can breathe.

Modern cement renders and gypsum plasters might seem like convenient solutions, but they can trap moisture inside your walls, leading to damp problems, crumbling stonework, and structural issues. That's where we come in.

### Our Work in Minchinhampton, Rodborough & Nailsworth

We regularly work on the stunning period properties in **Minchinhampton**, where Georgian and Victorian houses line the common and surrounding lanes. These buildings require a sympathetic approach – lime plastering that matches the original construction methods.

In **Rodborough**, the steep hillside properties present their own challenges. Rising damp is common in properties built into the slope, and we've developed expertise in addressing these issues without compromising the building's character.

**Nailsworth's** mix of former mill buildings and traditional cottages keeps us busy year-round. Whether it's repointing a stone barn conversion or lime rendering a listed townhouse, we bring the same attention to detail to every project.

### What Sets Us Apart

- **Local knowledge**: We know the area, the stone types, and what works
- **Traditional methods**: Proper lime plastering, not shortcuts
- **Honest advice**: We'll tell you what you actually need
- **Quality assured**: Professional workmanship on every project
