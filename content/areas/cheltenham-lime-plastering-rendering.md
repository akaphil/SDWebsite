## Lime Plastering and Rendering Specialists in Cheltenham

Cheltenham is Britain's most complete Regency town — a spa town built almost entirely within a single half-century between 1790 and 1840. With over 2,600 listed buildings and seven conservation areas covering more than 600 hectares, Cheltenham's architectural heritage is extraordinary. These elegant stuccoed terraces, villas, and crescents were all built using lime — lime mortar, lime render, and lime plaster — and that is exactly what they need to survive and thrive today.

We provide specialist lime plastering, lime rendering, and damp proofing services across Cheltenham and the surrounding Cotswold villages, bringing over 35 years of experience working with period properties to every project.

## Cheltenham's Regency Building Heritage

Cheltenham's transformation from a modest market town to one of England's finest spa towns began after George III visited in 1788 to take the waters. Within decades, an extraordinary building boom created the elegant townscape we see today. Almost the entire town centre was constructed between 1790 and 1840, giving Cheltenham a remarkable architectural coherence that few English towns can match.

<div class="content-block">
<h4>The Promenade & Montpellier</h4>
<p>The Promenade, laid out from 1818, is widely regarded as one of the finest streets in England. Montpellier, with its famous Caryatid figures supporting the former spa building, is a masterpiece of Regency design. These grand terraces were built with solid brick or stone walls, rendered externally in lime stucco and plastered internally with haired lime plaster — a breathable system that has served these buildings for two centuries.</p>

<div class="content-block content-block--gold">
<h4>Pittville & Lansdown</h4>
<p>Pittville, developed by Joseph Pitt from the 1820s, culminates in the magnificent Pump Room — Forbes' Greek Revival masterpiece with its Ionic colonnade. Lansdown features Papworth's elegant terraces and the Jearrad brothers' sweeping crescent. These ambitious developments relied entirely on traditional lime construction: lime mortar bedding, lime stucco facades, and lime plaster throughout.</p>

<div class="content-block content-block--slate">
<h4>Suffolk Square & Royal Crescent</h4>
<p>Suffolk Square (1823) with its Corinthian columns and Royal Crescent (1806–1810) represent the pinnacle of Cheltenham's Regency ambition. These are solid-walled buildings — no cavity walls, no damp-proof courses — designed to manage moisture through breathable lime-based materials. When those original materials are replaced with modern alternatives, the problems begin.</p>

### Why Cheltenham's Period Properties Need Lime

Every Regency and Georgian property in Cheltenham was built as a breathable system. The solid walls of brick or stone, bedded in lime mortar, were designed to absorb moisture and release it through evaporation. The original lime stucco facades and internal lime plasters were part of this system — porous enough to allow moisture movement, flexible enough to accommodate the natural movement of traditional buildings.

Problems arise when this breathable system is disrupted by incompatible modern materials:

- **Cement render** applied over original lime stucco traps moisture inside walls
- **Gypsum plaster** internally prevents moisture from evaporating inward
- **Vinyl wallpapers and impermeable paints** seal surfaces that were designed to breathe
- **Cement pointing** in place of lime mortar creates hard, impermeable joints

The result is predictable: rising damp, penetrating damp, black mould, decaying plaster, and deteriorating masonry. The solution is not chemical injection or tanking — it is restoring the breathable lime system these buildings were designed to use. Lime plastering in Cheltenham is not a luxury or a heritage nicety; it is essential building maintenance.

## Our Lime Plastering and Rendering Services in Cheltenham

We offer a full range of traditional lime services tailored to Cheltenham's Regency and period building stock:

**[Lime Rendering](/services/lime-rendering/)** — Restoring and renewing the stucco facades that define Cheltenham's streetscape. We use hydraulic lime (NHL 3.5) matched to the building's exposure and original specification, with locally sourced aggregates for an authentic finish.

**[Lime Plastering](/services/lime-plastering/)** — Internal lime plaster to replace failed gypsum or cement-based plasters. We use traditional haired lime plaster applied in multiple coats, and fat lime putty for finishing where appropriate. This restores breathability and eliminates trapped moisture.

**Lime Pointing and Repointing** — Careful removal of inappropriate cement pointing and replacement with lime mortar matched to the original. This is critical work — cement pointing causes adjacent stone and brick to crack and spall.

**[Damp Proofing](/services/damp-proofing/)** — Diagnosis and treatment of damp problems using breathable methods. We address root causes rather than masking symptoms, working with the building's original design rather than against it.

### Cheltenham's Conservation Areas

Cheltenham has seven designated conservation areas, with the Central Conservation Area alone covering 599 hectares and encompassing 19 distinct character areas. This is one of the largest conservation areas in England, reflecting the exceptional quality and completeness of Cheltenham's historic townscape.

For properties within these conservation areas — and particularly for the town's many listed buildings — the choice of materials for repair and restoration is not simply a matter of preference. Conservation officers expect compatible, traditional materials: lime mortars, lime renders, lime plasters, and breathable finishes. This effectively mandates lime-based products for any external or internal work on these properties.

We have extensive experience working within Cheltenham's conservation requirements and regularly liaise with conservation officers to ensure our specifications meet approval. We can advise on appropriate materials, methods, and finishes before you submit any applications.

## Common Damp Problems in Cheltenham Properties

Cheltenham's Regency properties are particularly susceptible to damp when their original lime systems have been compromised. The most common issues we encounter are:

- **Cement render over original lime stucco** — The single most damaging intervention. Cement is impermeable and traps moisture inside the wall, which then migrates inward causing internal damp, blown plaster, and black mould
- **Raised external ground levels** — Many Cheltenham properties now have ground levels higher than originally designed, introducing moisture below the intended threshold
- **Internal gypsum plaster** — Gypsum prevents moisture from evaporating through internal surfaces, concentrating damp at skirting level and behind furniture
- **Blocked chimneys and reduced ventilation** — Regency properties relied on open fires and natural ventilation to keep walls dry. Modern draught-proofing and blocked-up fireplaces can reduce airflow to problematic levels

Our approach is always the same: diagnose the root cause, remove incompatible materials, allow the walls to dry naturally, and restore the building with breathable lime plaster and lime render. This is not a quick fix — it is a proper, lasting solution that works with the building rather than against it.

## Cheltenham and Surrounding Cotswold Villages

Our lime plastering and lime rendering services extend well beyond Cheltenham town centre into the surrounding Cotswold villages, each with their own distinctive building heritage:

- **Prestbury** — One of Gloucestershire's most historic villages with its own conservation area spanning 26 hectares. Over 60 Grade II listed buildings line its streets, many built from Cotswold stone with buildings dating from the 14th to 18th centuries. The village's medieval core requires particularly sensitive lime work.

- **Charlton Kings** — Boasting three separate conservation areas, Charlton Kings has origins stretching back to the Iron Age. St Mary's Church dates from 1190, and the village contains numerous period manor houses and stone cottages requiring traditional lime maintenance.

- **Leckhampton** — Falling within Cheltenham's Central Conservation Area, Leckhampton has a rich history of limestone quarrying. The village offers a mix of Cotswold stone cottages and Victorian properties, many with original lime renders and plasters in need of sympathetic restoration.

- **Winchcombe** — Known as the "walking capital of the Cotswolds," Winchcombe is a treasure trove of Cotswold stone cottages, black-and-white half-timbered buildings, and historic architecture. St Peter's Church (1460s) and nearby Sudeley Castle demonstrate centuries of lime-based construction. The town's varied building stock presents wonderful challenges for lime specialists.

- **Bishop's Cleeve** — With 8th-century origins and a mention in the Domesday Book, Bishop's Cleeve contains buildings from the 12th and 13th centuries alongside later period properties, all requiring lime-compatible maintenance.

- **Gotherington** — Founded around 780 AD and recorded in the Domesday Book as "Godrinton," this stone-built Cotswold village retains its traditional character with properties that benefit from breathable lime renders and plasters.

- **Cleeve Hill** — At 330 metres, Cleeve Hill is the highest point in the Cotswolds. The stone-built properties on the escarpment face severe weather exposure, making the choice of lime render and pointing materials particularly important.

- **Woodmancote** — A rural parish with traditional Cotswold stone buildings that rely on breathable lime finishes to manage moisture in their exposed hilltop setting.

- **Shurdington** — Home to an Early English church and traditional stone buildings requiring careful lime maintenance to preserve their character.

- **Staverton** — An interesting mix of notable Regency stuccoed houses and 17th-century timber-framed buildings, each requiring different but equally traditional lime approaches.

- **Churchdown** — St Bartholomew's Church sits on a pre-Christian Iron Age site, and the village contains 16th-century cottages and later period properties, all built with lime-based materials.

- **Badgeworth** — The Church of the Holy Trinity in the Decorated Gothic style anchors this quiet parish of stone hamlets, where traditional lime renders and plasters remain the appropriate choice for building maintenance.
