## Lime Plastering & Damp Proofing Experts for Tetbury & Surrounds

Tetbury's picture-perfect market town centre and the grand estates of the surrounding countryside represent some of the finest traditional architecture in the Cotswolds. These buildings deserve craftsmen who understand their unique requirements.

### Tetbury's Architectural Heritage

From the iconic Market House to the wool merchants' houses lining Long Street, Tetbury's buildings tell the story of centuries of prosperity and careful stewardship. The surrounding villages – many centred around historic manor houses and farmsteads – continue this tradition of quality construction.

The area is particularly rich in buildings from the 17th and 18th centuries, when the wool trade brought wealth to the region. These properties were built to last, using locally quarried Cotswold stone and traditional lime mortars.

### Serving Westonbirt and the Estate Villages

**Westonbirt**, famous for its arboretum and the magnificent Westonbirt School (formerly Westonbirt House), has a special place in our work. The estate cottages and surrounding properties require the highest standards of craftsmanship, and we're proud to have worked on many buildings in the area.

The villages around Tetbury – **Shipton Moyne**, **Beverston**, **Leighterton** – are filled with properties that need proper care. Many have suffered from well-meaning but inappropriate repairs over the years. We help owners restore breathability to their buildings and address the damp problems that often result from cement repairs.

### Understanding the Local Building Stock

Properties in the Tetbury area share common characteristics:

- **Cotswold limestone construction** requiring lime-compatible materials
- **Exposed locations** on the high wold, meaning weather protection is crucial
- **Historic features** including original mullioned windows and stone details
- **Estate heritage** with many buildings part of larger historic estates

We've developed specific expertise in working with these building types, understanding how to achieve lasting repairs that respect the original construction.
