## The Challenge

This beautiful Georgian cottage had suffered from inappropriate cement render applied in the 1970s. The render had trapped moisture inside the walls, causing significant deterioration to the underlying stonework and internal damp problems.

The owners wanted to restore the property's original appearance while addressing the damp issues once and for all.

## Our Approach

After careful removal of the cement render – a painstaking process to avoid damaging the soft limestone beneath – we allowed the walls to dry out naturally over several weeks.

We then applied a traditional three-coat lime render system using NHL 3.5 hydraulic lime, mixed with locally-sourced sand to achieve an authentic colour match with neighbouring properties.

## The Result

The cottage now has a breathable external finish that will protect the stonework for generations to come. The owners have reported a noticeable improvement in the internal environment, with damp problems resolved and a fresher, healthier feel to the house.
