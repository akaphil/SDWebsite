## Who We Are

We're Severn Damp Proofing Ltd – a small team of experienced craftsmen based in Stroud, Gloucestershire. We specialise in two things: **traditional lime plastering** and **professional damp proofing**.

### Our Story

With over 35 years of combined experience in the trade, we've built our reputation on doing things properly. No shortcuts, no bodge jobs – just quality craftsmanship that stands the test of time.

We've worked on hundreds of properties across Gloucestershire and the Cotswolds, from modest cottages to grand country houses. Every project receives the same attention to detail, because that's simply how we work.

### Why We Focus on Lime

Early in our careers, we saw the damage that inappropriate materials can cause to old buildings. Cement renders trapping moisture. Gypsum plasters failing within years. Properties getting worse, not better.

That's when we committed to traditional methods. Lime plastering isn't just a service we offer – it's what we believe in. These materials have protected buildings for centuries, and when applied correctly, they'll continue to do so.

### Our Values

**Honesty First**
We'll tell you what you actually need, not what makes us the most money. Sometimes the best advice is to do nothing at all.

**Quality Over Speed**
Lime work can't be rushed. We take the time to do things properly, because a job done right lasts decades.

**Local Knowledge**
We know the Cotswolds – the stone types, the building traditions, what works and what doesn't. That local expertise matters.

**Standing Behind Our Work**
Every job comes with our 10-year insurance-backed guarantee. We're confident in our work, and we want you to be too.

### Our Guarantee

All our work is covered by a comprehensive 10-year insurance-backed guarantee. This means that even if something were to happen to us, your guarantee remains valid. It's the peace of mind you deserve when investing in your property.
